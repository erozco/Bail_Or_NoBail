<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### Inspiration:

Los Angeles County plans to bring back a Zero-Bail policy for those arrested on misdemeanors and non-violent offenders. Many in the county had concerns that when this policy was originally enacted it would have caused a spike in crime with those individuals let go becoming re-offenders. This no bail policy was first implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic starting on April 13, 2020 due to concerns of spreading COVID-19 in overcrowded jails. This was always planned to be a temporary measure due to the nature of the pandemic and the zero-bail policy ended on July 1, 2020. On October 1, 2023 Los Angeles County Police Departments will go back to the Zero-Bail Policy with no designated end-date.

### Technical Purpose:

Demonstrate dashboard development ability. Create template for myself to create dashboards more easily in the future. 

General exploratory analysis. 

### Goal (and possible additions):

I want to observe and analyze the rates of crimes during the enactment of this policy and prior to the policy. Obviously the original time window of this no cash bail policy is very short and during an odd time with several complex factors for fuctuations in crime. I leave this for possible updates in the future. The main focus here is to create a dash board to visualize these crimes.
